        The Weeknd, whose real name is Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, is a Canadian singer, songwriter, and record producer. Born on February 16, 1990, in Toronto, Canada, The Weeknd gained widespread recognition for his distinct voice, unique style, and the atmospheric R&B music he produces.

He first gained attention with a series of mixtapes released in 2010 and 2011, particularly "House of Balloons," "Thursday," and "Echoes of Silence." His debut studio album, "Kiss Land," was released in 2013, but it was his 2015 album "Beauty Behind the Madness" that catapulted him to international stardom.
The Weeknd's music often explores themes of love, relationships, and the darker side of fame. His voice, which has been described as hauntingly emotive, and his ability to blend various genres, including R&B, pop, and electronic music, have contributed to his critical and commercial success.

Beyond his music career, The Weeknd has been recognized for his performances at major award shows, including the Grammy Awards, and has become a significant figure in the contemporary music scene.
